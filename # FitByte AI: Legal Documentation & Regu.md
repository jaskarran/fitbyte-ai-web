## Part I: Privacy Policy

### 1. Data Collection & Architecture
FitByte AI utilizes a high-fidelity data architecture to process biometric information, including but not limited to body mass, age, activity metrics, and dietary intake. This data is synthesized to generate a personalized nutritional blueprint. All data is structured and persists within secure relational databases via Supabase, ensuring compartmentalized accessibility.

### 2. Biometric Synchronicity
Our platform provides optional integration with **Google Health Connect** and **Apple HealthKit**. These integrations facilitate the real-time synchronization of physiological metrics (e.g., step count and active energy expenditure). This data is utilized strictly for the dynamic recalibration of nutritional targets based on physical exertion.

### 3. Artificial Intelligence Protocols
Meal descriptions and nutritional queries are processed through sophisticated Large Language Models (LLMs), including the **Google Gemma series**. FitByte AI implements rigorous data anonymization protocols: PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is stripped from data packets prior to AI inference to ensure absolute user anonymity.

### 4. Cryptographic Security Standards
FitByte AI employs industry-standard encryption protocols to maintain data integrity:
*   **Data at Rest:** Protected using AES-256 encryption.
*   **Data in Transit:** Secured via TLS 1.3.
*   **Authentication:** Fortified by Firebase Authentication and Supabase Security Policies.

### 5. Data Sovereignty & Portability
Users maintain exclusive ownership of their biological and health data. We provide tools for immediate data portability, allowing for the export of complete historical records. Under the "Right to be Forgotten," account deletion requests will result in the permanent purging of all associated data from our systems within a 30-day window.

### 6. Regulatory Alignment
FitByte AI is architected to exceed global privacy standards, including:
*   **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation)
*   **CCPA** (California Consumer Privacy Act)
